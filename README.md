# 11yr_3c66b
Example Jupyter Notebook and Bayesian analysis chains for the NANOGrav 11yr 3C66B analysis.

In this notebook we will give several examples of how to reproduce plots and calcuations from the NANOGrav 3C66B analysis paper, which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07123. This notebook will also provide code to inspect the generated MCMC chains that are used to obtain those results.

Please contact the corresponding author at caitlin.witt@nanograv.org with questions. We are happy to provide the full length MCMC chains for use in your analyses upon request.
