# 11yr_3c66b
Example Jupyter Notebook and Bayesian analysis chains for the NANOGrav 11yr 3C66B analysis.

In this notebook we will give several examples of how to reproduce plots and calcuations from the NANOGrav 3C66B analysis paper, which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07123. This notebook will also provide code to inspect the generated MCMC chains that are used to obtain those results.

Please contact the corresponding author at caitlin.witt@nanograv.org with questions. We are happy to provide the full length MCMC chains for use in your analyses upon request. 

## Instructions
This notebook can be run online through the linked MyBinder, or downloaded and run locally with the listed package requirements. The initial cells can be run on each of the packaged chains to inspect the sampling of the MCMC. The subsequent sections use the packaged chains to recreate key plots and calculations from the analysis.
